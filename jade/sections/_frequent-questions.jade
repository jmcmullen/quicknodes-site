          strong What is shared web hosting?
          br
          | In Shared Web Hosting, multiple clients are hosted on a single server and all the clients share the server's resources. This helps reduce the cost, since the cost of the server and its resources are spread over all clients on the server. Shared Hosting is perfect for personal websites, small and mid-sized businesses that do not require all the resources of single server.

          strong What are the advantages of reseller hosting?
          br
          | If you're a web designer or developer you can host and manage all your websites and clients with one reseller hosting package instead of going through the hassle of managing multiple shared hosting packages. This also lowers your costs significantly. Additionally, you can resell hosting as a value added feature to your existing business or as a separate entity.
